# AtomBlast.io Public Issue Repository

Hey there! Welcome to the Public Issue Repository for AtomBlast! Here, we provide you with a structured way to contact the developers about bugs as well as feature requests about the game.

### Note to Devs
This is not the internal issue thread that we're using. Accepted issues from the public thread will be transferred over to the internal issue thread where we will work on them.

### I'm new here, what is AtomBlast??

AtomBlast is an online multiplayer arena game set at the atomic level. You control your own atom and fight with your team against other players to gain the most points. Collect atoms to craft into compounds with the click of a button- each compound has unique qualities that can help you attack, defend, and gain buffs! Strategically minded maps, weaponry, team play, and game modes only add to the fuel!!

### When should I create an issue?
Issues are currently the preferred method for posting bug reports and feature requests. Any other inquiries (requests to join the team, questions about payments, general questions and comments about gameplay, etc.) can be sent to the developers directly by emailing us at [contact@bananiumlabs.com](mailto:contact@bananiumlabs.com) or chatting with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/quNZb3s).

Before you post an issue, make sure that your issue or something similar has not already been created by searching the issues [here](https://github.com/BananiumLabs/AtomBlastPublicIssues/issues). See the below image for a visual.

### How to Create an Issue
It's actually very easy! First, go to the `issues` tab on the top of the page; or, [click here](https://github.com/BananiumLabs/AtomBlastPublicIssues/issues) for a shortcut!

When you get into the Issues page, you can create a new issue by clicking on the green `New Issue` button:

Here, you can select the template that suits your need (either the Bug template or Feature template).

When you are in the template, read all the instructions in the comments to make sure that the issue is as complete as possible. Make sure you have a descriptive title so others can find your issue too!

In addition, be sure to add a label (either `bug` or `enhancement` depending on what kind of issue you have).

When you're done, click submit and your issue should appear on the top of the list :) All done!

### Duplicate Issues
Again, be completely sure that someone else has not put in a similar issue as you by taking a few minutes to search the issues beforehand! If someone has already created an issue that you agree with, add a thumbs up or comment to their issue to let us know that you also want that to be added/fixed.
